## Getting Started

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
*   [Your Database System] (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL) installed and running.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-project-folder>
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd backend # or wherever your backend code is located
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend # or wherever your frontend code is located
    npm install # or yarn install
    ```

### Configuration

1.  **Backend Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in your `backend` directory and add the following environment variables:
    ```
    PORT=5000
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    # Add any other necessary backend environment variables
    ```
    *Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual database connection string.*

2.  **Frontend Environment Variables (if applicable):**
    If your frontend requires environment variables (e.g., for API URLs), create a `.env` file in your `frontend` directory:
    ```
    REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
    # Add any other necessary frontend environment variables
    ```
    *Adjust the `REACT_APP_API_URL` to match your backend server's address.*

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    The backend server should now be running, typically on `http://localhost:5000`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm start # or yarn start
    ```
    The frontend application should open in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints (if applicable)

If your project has a RESTful API, document its endpoints here.

**Books:**

*   `GET /api/books`: Get all books.
*   `GET /api/books/:id`: Get a single book by ID.
*   `POST /api/books`: Add a new book.
*   `PUT /api/books/:id`: Update a book by ID.
*   `DELETE /api/books/:id`: Delete a book by ID.
